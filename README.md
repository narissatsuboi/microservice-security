# microservice-security-literature review

Abstract— A microservice architecture is a loosely coupled 
network of microservices, deployed in a cloud-native application [1]. 
This architecture is still considered new and is rapidly implemented 
to achieve high scale business needs. The speed and scalability of 
microservice architecture is well established, but what are the 
challenges of securing this complex, rapidly changing architecture? 
The aim of this literature review is to summarize the current issues 
in microservice security and find best practices that multiple sources 
agree on. This literature review was conducted on four white 
literature sources, deemed “core papers” and found that there are 
many issues associated with microservice architecture, the most of 
which occur at the microservice and application layer. Best practices 
and standards are not well recorded and accepted across the 
industry, but some sources agreed on multiple best practices. This 
paper can be used to assess the issues and best practices in 
microservice security from a mix of white and grey literature.
